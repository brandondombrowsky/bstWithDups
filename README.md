# bstWithDups
This project had us learning to code a binary search tree with duplicates, utilizing the x = change(x) function coding approach, implementing recursion for Tree algorithms, all using generics. We were also required to create object and class diagrams before we started coding, which are included in the DesignDocs file.

# Contents of src file:
  1. Main - to demo code functionality
  2. BstDup - all relevant functional code
  3. BstDupInterface - the provided interface
  4. BstDupTest - to test all functions

# Included input files:
  1. intFile.txt - a list of 30 integers
  2. intTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 integers
  3. stringFile.txt - a list of 30 Strings
  4. stringTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 Strings

# Build instructions:
> The build insructions to make bstWithDups work
- Copy each Java file into its own class with matching name
- Copy each text file into its own text file with matching name
- Alternatively download and drag entire src file into desktop IDE icon
- Run program from Main class  
- No bugs or runtime errors expected

# Code output:
> A text file called Results.txt
