# bstWithDups
This project had us learning to code binary search trees with duplicates, utilizing the x = change(x) approach, implementing recursion for Tree algorithms, all while using generics. We were also required to create object and class diagrams before we started coding.

# Contents of src file:
  1. Main.java - to demo code functionality
  2. BstDup.java - all relevant functional code
  3. BstDupInterface.java - the provided interface
  4. BstDupTest.java - to test all functions
  5. intFile.txt - a list of 30 integers
  6. intTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 integers
  7. stringFile.txt - a list of 30 Strings
  8. stringTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 Strings

# Build Instructions:
> The build insructions to make bstWithDups work.
- Copy each Java file into its own class with matching name in new source folder.
- Copy each text file into its own text file with matching name in same source file.
- Alternatively, download and drag entire src file into desktop IDE icon.
- Run program from Main class.
- No bugs or runtime errors expected.

# Code Output:
> A text file called Results.txt:
