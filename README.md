# bstWithDups
This project had us learning to code a binary search tree with duplicates, utilizing the x = change(x) function coding approach, implementing recursion for Tree algorithms, all using generics. We were also required to create object and class diagrams before we started coding, which are included in the DesignDocs file.

A. The included src file contains the following classes:
  1. Main - to demo code functionality
  2. BstDup - all relevant functional code
  3. BstDupInterface - the provided interface
  4. BstDupTest - to test all functions

B. The included input files:
  1. intFile.txt - a list of 30 integers
  2. intTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 integers
  3. stringFile.txt - a list of 30 Strings
  4. stringTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 Strings

C. Running the code outputs a file called:
  1. Results.txt
