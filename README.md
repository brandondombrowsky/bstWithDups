# bstWithDups
This project had us learning to code a binary search tree with duplicates, utilizing the x = change(x) function coding approach, implementing recursion for Tree algorithms, all using generics. We were also required to create object and class diagrams before we started coding, which are included in the DesignDocs file.

# Contents of src file:
  1. Main - to demo code functionality
  2. BstDup - all relevant functional code
  3. BstDupInterface - the provided interface
  4. BstDupTest - to test all functions

# Included input files:
  1. intFile.txt - a list of 30 integers
  2. intTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 integers
  3. stringFile.txt - a list of 30 Strings
  4. stringTestFile.txt - a test file with 10 Strings

# Build instructions:
> The build insructions to make bstWithDups work
- Copy each Java file into its own class with matching name or drag entire src file into IDE
- Download each input file into same file containing sourse code
- Run program from Main class  
- No bugs or runtime errors expected

Code output file:
  A text file called Results.txt
